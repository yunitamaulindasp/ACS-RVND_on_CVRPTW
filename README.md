# The Implementation of the Ant Colony System with Randomized Variable Neighbourhood Descent (ACS-RVND) on the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)
This program is an implementation of the Ant Colony System with Randomized Variable Neighbourhood Descent (ACS-RVND) algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) to obtain the most optimal distance and delivery time.
The program is developed using one of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages, which is Borland Delphi 7.
It utilizes three types of input data: manual input, .txt-formatted output data, and .xml-formatted dataset.
